Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    Inheritance affects my constructors in this program specifically because I had to make sure I was taking in the parameters for the parent class as well. You then have to call the constructor in the super class or else the constructor won't work. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? 
    I had a hard time with the constructors at first but once I was able to fix it everything worked out nicely. I also at first didn't add any catches for different circumstances but once I remembered there are certain times I do not want the method to work exactly how I wrote it, I wrote some catch if else statements.
